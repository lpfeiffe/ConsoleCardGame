Game Outline:
1. Place wager
2. Dealer deals out 2 cards to each player and one card face up for themselves
3. Player decides how to play the hand
    a. STAND - first two cards are acceptable
    b. HIT - get another card to improve your hand total until you bust or choose to stand
    c. DOUBLE DOWN - if you have a hand that is advantageous to you but you need to take
                     an additional card, you can double your initial wager and the dealer will
                     deal 1 additional card
    d. SPLIT - if dealt a pair (2 cards of equal value) you have the option to put out a second
               wager and the dealer will split the two cards so that each card will become the
               first card on two new hands
    e. SURRENDER - if you don't like your initial hand, you have the option of giving it up in
                   exchange for half your original bet back
4. Dealer flips over their face down card. If they have a hand total of 17 or higher, they will
   automatically stand. If it is 16 or lower, they will take additional hit cards
    a. If the dealer is delt an ACE and a six (soft 17), then the ACE will be counted as a 7, and
       the dealer will HIT
